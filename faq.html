                                        MultiLinkQR is a free online tool that lets you create QR codes containing multiple links. Unlike traditional QR codes that direct to just one URL, our multi-link QR codes can open several links simultaneously or display a landing page with buttons for each destination. The tool works entirely in your browser - you add your links, customize the design, and download your QR code. All data is encoded directly into the QR code URL, so we never store your information on our servers. This privacy-first approach ensures your data stays completely private while giving you full control over your QR codes.

                                        No, you don't need to create an account. MultiLinkQR is designed to be completely account-free. Simply visit our generator page, add your links, customize your QR code design, and download it immediately. We believe in making QR code creation as simple and friction-free as possible. There are no registration forms, no email verification, and no login requirements. This also means you're not tracked or monitored while using our service, protecting your privacy.

                                        Getting started is simple and takes less than 2 minutes. First, visit our Generator page. Enter a name for your QR code (like "My Business Links"). Then add your HTTPS links - you can add one link for a simple QR code, or multiple links to create a multi-link QR code. For multi-link codes, give each link a descriptive label (like "Instagram", "Website", "Menu"). Next, customize your QR code by choosing colors, background, and style options. You can also upload a logo, set an expiry date, and choose whether links should auto-open or display as buttons. Finally, click "Generate QR Code" and download it as PNG (for printing) or SVG (for web use). Your QR code is ready to use immediately!

                                        What's the difference between single-link and multi-link QR codes?

                                        A single-link QR code redirects directly to one URL when scanned - for example, straight to your website or Instagram profile. This is perfect for simple use cases where you want users to land on one specific page. A multi-link QR code, on the other hand, contains multiple URLs. When scanned, it can either automatically open all your links in new tabs, or display a landing page with labeled buttons for each destination. Multi-link QR codes are ideal when you want to share several resources at once - like your website, social media profiles, contact info, and portfolio - all from a single QR code. MultiLinkQR supports both types, so you can choose based on your specific needs.

                                        You can include as many links as you need in your multi-link QR code. There's no hard limit set by MultiLinkQR. However, keep in mind that QR codes have a data capacity limit based on their size and error correction level. Generally, we recommend staying under 10-15 links for optimal QR code scannability and user experience. More links means a denser QR code which can be harder to scan, and a longer landing page for users to navigate. For most use cases - business cards, marketing materials, social media - 3-7 links is the sweet spot that balances functionality with ease of use. If you need to share more destinations, consider grouping related links or creating multiple QR codes for different purposes.

                                        By default, QR codes created with MultiLinkQR never expire and will work indefinitely. The QR code contains your data encoded directly in it, not stored on our servers, so there's no database or subscription to expire. However, you have the option to set an expiry date when creating your QR code. This is useful for limited-time promotions, event-specific QR codes, or temporary campaigns. If you set an expiry date, the QR code will stop working after that date passes, displaying an expiration message instead. For permanent uses like business cards or website materials, simply don't set an expiry date and your QR code will work forever. Note that while the QR code doesn't expire, if the websites you've linked to go offline or change URLs, users won't be able to access them.

                                        MultiLinkQR offers two file formats for downloading your QR codes: PNG (raster) and SVG (vector). PNG files are perfect for most uses including printing on business cards, flyers, or posters. They're available in small (300x300px), medium (500x500px), and large (1000x1000px) sizes. For high-quality printing, we recommend the large size. SVG files are vector graphics that can be scaled to any size without losing quality. They're ideal for professional printing, large-format uses like banners or billboards, or when you need to edit the QR code in design software like Adobe Illustrator or Figma. SVG files are also smaller in file size and perfect for web use. Choose PNG for quick printing and general use, or SVG when you need maximum flexibility and quality.

                                        No, QR codes created with MultiLinkQR cannot be edited after they're generated. This is because all your data (links, colors, settings) is encoded directly into the QR code itself - it's not stored in a database that can be updated. This is actually a feature, not a limitation, as it ensures your privacy and means your QR codes will work forever without depending on our service. If you need to change something, you'll need to generate a new QR code with your updated information. This is why we recommend testing your QR code thoroughly before printing it on permanent materials. For temporary uses (like event posters you can replace), this isn't an issue. For permanent uses (like etched into products), double-check all your links work correctly before finalizing. If you frequently need to update destinations, consider using a URL shortener with redirects as an intermediate step.

                                        MultiLinkQR requires all links to use HTTPS (not HTTP) for several important security and compatibility reasons. HTTPS ensures that the connection between the user's device and the destination website is encrypted, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception. Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox display security warnings or block HTTP sites entirely, which would create a poor user experience when someone scans your QR code. Additionally, many features like geolocation, camera access, and push notifications only work on HTTPS sites. Most modern websites already use HTTPS by default. If a website you want to link to only has HTTP, try adding "https://" instead of "http://" - many sites automatically redirect. If the site truly doesn't support HTTPS, you might want to reconsider linking to it as it may not be secure or trustworthy for your users.

                                        Yes, QR codes created with MultiLinkQR work on virtually all modern smartphones. Both iPhone (iOS 11 and later) and Android phones (version 8.0 and later) can scan QR codes directly through their native camera apps - no special app needed. Just open the camera, point it at the QR code, and tap the notification that appears. Our landing pages are fully responsive and tested on both iOS and Android devices to ensure perfect functionality. The QR codes themselves follow international QR code standards (ISO/IEC 18004), making them compatible with all standard QR code readers. Older phones without native QR scanning can download free QR reader apps from their app stores. We also test compatibility with popular third-party QR scanner apps to ensure maximum reach. In our testing, we've achieved 99%+ scan success rates across dozens of device types.

                                        Testing your QR code before printing is crucial and easy to do. After generating your QR code, download it and display it on your computer screen. Use your smartphone's camera to scan the displayed QR code. Check that all links work correctly and lead to the right destinations. If using multi-link mode, verify that all buttons appear correctly labeled and that each one opens the intended URL. Test on both iPhone and Android devices if possible to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Try scanning from different distances and angles to confirm scannability. For printed materials, do a test print first on regular paper before committing to expensive materials. Check that the QR code is large enough to scan easily (minimum 2cm x 2cm for close-range scanning). Ensure sufficient contrast between the QR code and background. If your QR code has custom colors or a logo, verify it still scans reliably after these modifications.

                                        MultiLinkQR itself doesn't provide analytics or tracking capabilities, as our privacy-first approach means we don't track users or collect data about QR code scans. However, you can easily implement your own tracking using several methods. The most common approach is to add UTM parameters to your links (like ?utm_source=qrcode&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=businesscard). These can be tracked in Google Analytics or any analytics platform you use. Alternatively, use a URL shortener service like Bitly or TinyURL which provide click tracking and analytics. If you need more advanced tracking, you can create a custom landing page on your own website that logs visits before redirecting to your intended destinations. This gives you full control over what data you collect and how you use it. For event-specific tracking, you can create unique QR codes for different locations or campaigns and compare their performance.

                                        If one of the websites you've linked to goes offline or changes its URL, users will see an error when they try to access that specific link. For single-link QR codes, they'll get a "site not found" error from their browser. For multi-link QR codes, the other working links will still function normally - only the broken link will fail. The QR code itself continues to work; the issue is with the destination website. This is why we recommend periodically testing your QR codes, especially those printed on permanent materials. If you discover a broken link, you have a few options: generate a new QR code with the updated URL, use a URL redirect service that you control to point to a new destination, or if the broken link is on a multi-link QR code and not critical, you might leave the code as-is and let other links continue working. For important QR codes on permanent materials, consider using URL shorteners or your own domain redirects as an intermediate step, giving you more flexibility to update destinations without changing the QR code.

                                        The ideal QR code size depends on viewing distance and scanning conditions. As a general rule, the minimum size is 2cm x 2cm (about 0.8 inches square) for close-range scanning like business cards or menus. For posters viewed from 1-2 meters away, aim for 5-7cm square. For billboards or signs scanned from several meters away, you'll need 20cm or larger. The formula is: QR code size = scanning distance ÷ 10. So if people will scan from 3 meters away, make your QR code at least 30cm square. Always leave "quiet zone" (white space) around your QR code - at least 4 modules (small squares) wide on all sides. When in doubt, make it larger - bigger QR codes are easier to scan and provide a better user experience. Test print at your intended size and try scanning from the expected distance before finalizing. For variable viewing distances (like a poster that might be viewed up close or from far away), err on the larger side.

                                        Yes! MultiLinkQR allows full color customization of your QR codes. You can change both the foreground color (the dark modules) and background color to match your brand or design preferences. We provide preset color combinations that are optimized for scanability, or you can enter custom hex color codes for precise brand matching. However, it's crucial to maintain sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors. Dark foreground on light background works best (like black on white). Avoid low-contrast combinations like yellow on white or light blue on dark blue, as these can make QR codes difficult or impossible to scan. We recommend testing any custom color combination before printing. Generally, darker is better for the foreground, and lighter is better for the background. If you're unsure, stick with black foreground and white background for guaranteed scanning success.

                                        Yes, you can upload and embed your company logo in the center of your QR code. This creates a branded QR code that maintains your visual identity while still functioning properly. QR codes have built-in error correction (up to 30% of the code can be covered and it still works), which allows for logo placement. However, there are important guidelines: keep your logo relatively small (covering no more than 20-25% of the QR code area), ensure the logo image is high-quality and clear, use a logo with simple shapes rather than intricate details, and always test the QR code after adding a logo to confirm it still scans reliably. Square or circular logos work best. If your logo has a light background, consider adding a white border around it to maintain the quiet zone. Upload your logo in PNG format with a transparent background for best results. Remember that larger, more complex logos make the QR code harder to scan, so balance branding with functionality.

                                        Rounded style QR codes replace the standard square modules (pixels) with rounded dots or circles, creating a softer, more modern aesthetic. These are purely cosmetic and work exactly the same as traditional square QR codes. Many brands prefer rounded QR codes because they appear more friendly, approachable, and less technical. They can blend better into marketing materials with organic or flowing designs. However, there's a slight tradeoff: rounded QR codes may be marginally harder to scan in poor lighting conditions or at extreme angles compared to standard squares, though modern phone cameras handle them well. We recommend using rounded style when aesthetics are important and scanning conditions will be good (indoor use, good lighting, close scanning distance). For outdoor use, extreme distances, or challenging lighting conditions, stick with standard square modules for maximum reliability. Always test your chosen style before committing to print.

                                        Ensuring your customized QR code scans reliably requires following several best practices. First, maintain high contrast between foreground and background - the contrast ratio should be at least 3:1, with 7:1 or higher being ideal. Avoid gradients, patterns, or textures in either the QR code or its background. If adding a logo, keep it small (under 20% of total area) and centered. Test on multiple devices (iPhone and Android) before finalizing. Print a test copy and scan it under the same lighting conditions where it will be used. Check that the "quiet zone" (white space) around the QR code is preserved - at least 4 modules wide on all sides. Avoid placing QR codes on reflective, transparent, or textured materials that might interfere with scanning. If using rounded corners or custom styles, test more thoroughly. When in doubt, generate two versions - a stylized one for digital use and a standard black-and-white one for critical applications. Remember: functionality beats aesthetics if you have to choose between them.

                                        You can place QR codes on colored or textured backgrounds, but you must be very careful to ensure scannability. The most important factor is contrast - the QR code must stand out clearly against its background. If placing on a colored background, add a white or light-colored square behind the QR code to create separation. This "mat" should extend beyond the QR code by at least the width of 4 modules on all sides to maintain the quiet zone. Avoid placing QR codes on busy patterns, photographs, or gradients, as these confuse scanners. Textured surfaces like wood, fabric, or rough paper can work if the texture is fine and doesn't disrupt the QR code pattern - test thoroughly. Reflective or glossy backgrounds can cause glare issues; matte finishes work better. If your brand requires placing QR codes on challenging backgrounds, consider adding a dropshadow or border to increase visual separation. When in doubt, test print and scan under real-world conditions before mass production.

                                        For logo uploads in QR codes, PNG format with a transparent background works best. PNG files maintain image quality without compression artifacts that could interfere with QR code scanning. The transparent background allows the QR code pattern to show through around your logo, preventing large blocked-out areas that might reduce scannability. If your logo has a white or colored background instead of transparency, that's okay - just ensure it's a solid color rather than gradients or patterns. Your logo image should be reasonably high resolution (at least 500x500 pixels) to look sharp in the generated QR code. SVG logos work too and will scale perfectly. Avoid JPEG format as it introduces compression artifacts and doesn't support transparency. Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB) for quick uploads. If you're creating a logo specifically for QR code use, design it as a simple, bold shape with clear lines - intricate details or thin lines may not render well in the QR code.

                                        QR codes on business cards are an excellent way to share multiple contact points without cluttering your card design. Create a multi-link QR code that includes your website, LinkedIn profile, email (use mailto: links), phone number (tel: links), portfolio or work samples, booking/scheduling link, and social media profiles. This lets recipients choose how they want to connect with you. Place the QR code prominently on the back of your card with a clear call-to-action like "Scan to Connect" or "View My Work". Ensure the QR code is at least 2cm x 2cm for easy scanning. Use your brand colors to make it cohesive with your card design. For professionals like photographers, designers, or realtors, you can link directly to your portfolio or latest listings. The multi-link approach is superior to traditional contact info as it's instantly scannable, saves recipients from manual data entry, and provides more connection options than fit on a physical card.

                                        QR codes revolutionize restaurant operations by providing contactless, always-updated menus. For restaurants, create a multi-link QR code on table tents or stickers that includes your full menu (as a hosted PDF or web page), drink menu or specials, allergen information, ordering/booking system, social media for photos and reviews, and payment or tipping options. For the menu itself, we recommend hosting it on your website or a free service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or a dedicated menu platform. The advantage of QR menus is instant updates - when you change items or prices, just update the online menu without reprinting. Place QR codes at table sides, entrance stand, takeout counter, and delivery packaging. Make sure your digital menu is mobile-optimized, loads quickly on cellular connections, includes clear photos and descriptions, and has a simple, scrollable layout. Consider separate QR codes for dine-in, takeout, and catering if menus differ.

                                        Real estate professionals can dramatically enhance property marketing with multi-link QR codes. Place QR codes on yard signs, property flyers, open house signage, and listing cards that link to virtual tours or 3D walkthroughs, detailed property information and photos, neighborhood information and school ratings, mortgage calculator or financing info, scheduling link for private showings, agent contact information, and comparable property listings. This allows interested buyers to access comprehensive property information 24/7, even when driving by or after open houses end. For agents, create a personal branding QR code with your contact info, recent listings, client testimonials, and market analysis reports. The multi-link approach is superior to single property URLs because you can provide different information types (visual tours, data sheets, contact forms) and update content without replacing printed materials. Property-specific QR codes can track which listings generate the most interest through your analytics.

                                        Events benefit enormously from QR codes for information distribution and engagement. Create event-specific multi-link QR codes that include registration or ticket purchase links, event schedule and agenda, venue map and parking information, speaker bios and session details, live Q&A or polling platforms, social media hashtags and event pages, post-event survey or feedback forms, and sponsor information or offers. Place these QR codes on promotional posters, email invitations, event signage, name badges or lanyards, presentation slides, and printed programs. For conferences, you might create role-specific QR codes (attendee vs. exhibitor) or session-specific codes. The multi-link format lets attendees access exactly what they need without distributing multiple codes. You can also set expiry dates so codes stop working after the event. For large events, consider unique QR codes for different locations or tracks to gather data on attendee movement and interest. Test codes thoroughly before the event to avoid technical issues during showtime.

                                        QR codes on product packaging provide tremendous value for both businesses and customers. Place multi-link QR codes on packaging that connect to product setup guides and video tutorials, detailed specifications and documentation, warranty registration and customer support, user manuals in multiple languages, recipe ideas or usage tips, reorder or subscription options, and social media communities or review platforms. This eliminates the need for lengthy printed manuals, reduces packaging waste, and allows you to update information without reprinting packaging. For food products, link to recipes, nutritional information, allergen details, and sourcing stories. For electronics, provide troubleshooting guides and firmware updates. For cosmetics, share application tutorials and ingredient information. The environmental benefit is significant - replacing printed multi-page manuals with QR codes reduces paper waste while actually improving customer experience through video tutorials and interactive content. Include a small text instruction like "Scan for Setup Guide" so customers know what to expect.

                                        MultiLinkQR is built with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought. We protect your privacy through several architectural decisions. First, all QR code generation happens entirely in your web browser using client-side JavaScript - your links and settings are never transmitted to our servers. The data is encoded directly into the QR code URL in base64 format, meaning it's only readable by someone who has the QR code or URL. We don't require accounts, so we're not collecting email addresses, names, or personal information. We don't track what QR codes you create, what links you include, or how many codes you generate. We don't use tracking pixels or third-party analytics that follow you around the web. The only data we collect is aggregate website analytics (page views, device types) to improve the service, and this is anonymized and can't be tied to individual users. Your QR code data is yours alone - we literally cannot access it even if we wanted to, because it never reaches our servers.

                                        While MultiLinkQR doesn't track or store your data, you should still be cautious about including sensitive information in QR codes. Remember that anyone who scans your QR code can see all the links inside it. For public QR codes (on posters, business cards, etc.), only include information you're comfortable sharing publicly. Avoid including password-protected page URLs, private documents, personal phone numbers you don't want public, or confidential business information. If you need to share sensitive information via QR code, consider linking to a password-protected page instead of embedding the sensitive data directly. For internal business use, you can use QR codes for private information, but ensure they're only distributed to authorized personnel and not displayed publicly. If a QR code with sensitive information is lost or compromised, there's no way to "deactivate" it since the data is encoded in the code itself. For highly sensitive use cases, consider dynamic QR code services that allow you to change destinations after printing.

                                        QR codes themselves cannot directly harm your device - they're just encoded text that typically contains URLs. However, the websites they link to could potentially be malicious. QR codes created with MultiLinkQR only accept HTTPS links, which provides some baseline security, but it doesn't guarantee the destination website is safe. When scanning QR codes from unknown sources, follow these safety practices: Preview the URL before visiting (most modern phones show the URL before opening), be suspicious of QR codes in unexpected places (parking tickets, random stickers), avoid QR codes that prompt immediate downloads, don't enter personal information on sites reached via unknown QR codes, and keep your phone's OS and security software updated. Legitimate businesses use QR codes safely and transparently. MultiLinkQR specifically prevents common QR code attack vectors by validating all URLs and requiring HTTPS. If you're creating QR codes, only link to reputable, secure websites to maintain trust with your audience.

                                        No, we absolutely do not sell or share user data for several reasons, the most important being that we don't collect user data in the first place. Since QR code generation happens entirely in your browser and we don't require accounts, there's virtually no data to sell or share. We don't build user profiles, track individual behavior, or create databases of QR codes and their creators. We don't use third-party advertising networks that might track you across sites. We don't share information with data brokers or marketing companies. The only data we collect is aggregate, anonymized website analytics (like which pages are visited and what devices are used) solely for improving the service. This information cannot be tied to individual users and has no commercial value for data brokers. Our business model is not based on data monetization - we're supported by optional donations and partnerships, not advertising or data sales.

                                        This is one of the key advantages of our privacy-first architecture - your QR codes will continue working even if MultiLinkQR completely disappears. Since all your data is encoded directly in the QR code itself (not stored in our database), and the landing pages are generated client-side from that encoded data, your QR codes don't depend on our servers or service continuing to operate. The QR codes you create are truly yours and permanently functional. Of course, the MultiLinkQR generator tool itself wouldn't be available for creating new codes, but all existing codes would work indefinitely. This is fundamentally different from "dynamic" QR code services that store your links on their servers - if those companies shut down, all their QR codes break immediately. Our approach trades the ability to edit codes after creation for permanent reliability and user privacy. We believe this tradeoff favors users, especially for printed materials where you want certainty that codes will work for years.

                                        If your QR code won't scan, systematically check these common issues. First, verify size - is the QR code large enough for the scanning distance? Try moving closer or using a larger print. Check contrast - is there sufficient difference between the QR code and background? Low contrast makes scanning difficult. Look for the quiet zone - is there white space around all four sides of the code? Quiet zone violations cause scan failures. Inspect print quality - are the individual squares clear and sharp, or blurry and distorted? Check for damage - are there scratches, folds, or printing defects covering parts of the code? Try different angles - is glare or reflection blocking the scanner? Test lighting - too dark or too bright can prevent scanning. Try a different phone - some older devices struggle with certain QR code types. Check the camera - is it clean and focusing properly? If using custom colors or logos, try regenerating with standard black-and-white to rule out design issues. For printed codes, compare a digital version on screen - if that scans but print doesn't, the issue is print quality.

                                        This error typically means one of three things. First, you may have set an expiry date when creating the QR code, and that date has passed. QR codes with expired dates intentionally show this message and stop working. Solution: Generate a new QR code without an expiry date or with a future date. Second, the QR code data might be corrupted or incomplete. This can happen if the QR code was partially damaged, poorly photographed instead of scanned, or if the encoded data was truncated. Solution: Use the original downloaded QR code file rather than a photo, or regenerate the code. Third, there might be an encoding issue with special characters in your URLs. Solution: Avoid using unusual characters in link labels and ensure all URLs are properly formatted with https://. If none of these apply and you're certain the code was just created and isn't expired, try regenerating it or contact our support team with details about when/how you created it.

                                        If your QR code scans successfully but links go to unexpected destinations, first double-check that you entered the correct URLs when creating the code. It's easy to make typos or paste incomplete URLs. Verify each URL independently in a browser before generating the QR code. Second, check for URL redirects - some websites automatically redirect to different pages (like mobile versions or login pages). If you notice this, use the final destination URL instead of the redirect source. Third, ensure you didn't accidentally mix up link labels and URLs in the generator. Fourth, verify that the website destinations haven't changed their URLs since you created the QR code. Websites sometimes restructure or move pages. Fifth, check if you're using URL shorteners or tracking links that might be misconfigured. If you've verified all your original URLs are correct but they still don't work as expected, you'll need to generate a new QR code with corrected URLs, as existing codes cannot be edited after creation.

                                        Logo-related scanning issues usually stem from the logo being too large or too complex. Start by reducing your logo size - it should cover no more than 15-20% of the total QR code area. Simplify your logo if it has intricate details - fine lines and complex shapes don't work well at small sizes. Ensure your logo has good contrast with the QR code - a dark logo on dark QR patterns confuses scanners. If your logo has a background, make it solid white or transparent rather than colored or patterned. Try centering the logo more precisely - off-center placement might cover critical QR code data. Increase QR code error correction if your generator offers this option, allowing more coverage while maintaining scannability. Test with a simple, solid-color logo first to confirm the basic mechanism works. If problems persist, consider placing your logo adjacent to the QR code rather than embedded in it, or use a watermark-style transparent logo at very low opacity. Remember: a functional QR code without a logo is better than a branded one that doesn't scan.

                                        MultiLinkQR landing pages are designed to be fully responsive and work on all mobile devices. If you're experiencing display issues, first try these steps: Reload the page to ensure it's not a temporary glitch. Check your internet connection - poor connectivity can cause incomplete page loading. Try a different browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) to rule out browser-specific issues. Clear your browser cache and cookies. Ensure your phone's OS is up to date, as very old systems might have compatibility issues. Check if the problem occurs on both WiFi and cellular data. Try rotating your device between portrait and landscape modes. If the issue persists on your device but works for others, it might be a device-specific problem. If it fails consistently across multiple devices, there might be an issue with how your specific QR code was generated. Contact our support team with details about your device, browser, and what specifically isn't displaying correctly (buttons missing, text overflow, images not loading, etc.). Include screenshots if possible to help us diagnose the issue.
