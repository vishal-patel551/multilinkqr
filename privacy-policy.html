                          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">How Your QR Code Data Works</h2>
                          <p>
                              When you create a QR code using MultiLinkQR, all your information (links, labels, colors, 
                              settings, etc.) is processed entirely in your web browser using JavaScript. Here's how it works:
                          </p>
                          <ol>
                              <li><strong>Client-Side Processing:</strong> All data you enter is processed locally in your 
                                  browser. Nothing is sent to our servers during the QR code generation process.</li>
                              <li><strong>URL Encoding:</strong> Your settings and links are encoded into a base64 string 
                                  and embedded directly into the generated URL (for multi-link QR codes).</li>
                              <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We don't store your QR code data on our servers. 
                                  The only way someone can access your links is if they have the QR code itself or the 
                                  generated URL.</li>
                              <li><strong>Direct Access:</strong> Anyone who scans your QR code or has the URL can decode 
                                  and access the information you encoded. This is by design, as it allows your QR codes to 
                                  work without requiring our servers to be online.</li>
                          </ol>
                          <p class="mb-0">
                              <strong>Important:</strong> Because your data is encoded in the URL, anyone with access to 
                              the QR code or URL can see the links you've included. Only include links you're comfortable 
                              sharing publicly. Never encode sensitive information like passwords, personal data, or private 
                              content in your QR codes.
                          </p>
